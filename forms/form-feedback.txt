Thu,  8 Jan 2009 14:51:32 -0500	172.24.88.182	Beverly Simmons		John Friedl	UHON317	001	Undergraduate Student	I don\'t have any additional questions right now.	Prior to the session, I had no experience with Lexis-Nexis, and the session was very helpful. I learned how to search for specific court cases.	Not sure...

I learned how to quickly retrieve info on court cases using Lexis Nexis.	I would like to see Beverly teach exactly what she just taught.. GREAT JOB!
Thu,  8 Jan 2009 14:53:35 -0500	172.24.88.190	Beverly Simmons		Friedl	UHON317	001	Undergraduate Student	I don\'t feel confused.  	I learned how to search for law articles and cases on the Lexis-Nexis database.  	I would like to see efficient and quick instruction--it\'s better to err on the side of being too fast for a video which is easily repeatable.  If there are long pauses it becomes more difficult to review.
