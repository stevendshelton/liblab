The Assignment Calculator is written in PHP.  You must have a PHP
enabled web server in order for it to work.  Any version of PHP 
should work fine. All you need to do to install it is put the files
in a directory on your web server.  

The Assignment Calculator at the University of Minnesota also has 
what we call "email reminder" funcionality.  This functionality was
stripped out of this distribution due to its reliance on U of M 
specific applications, such as our campus wide x.500 authentication 
system.  If you would like this code also please let me know and I 
will try to work on a distribution with that code included.

Of course, if you can think of any way to improve the code let me know.
The orginal code was written over 3 years ago by a former student
worker.  I like it for its simplicity, but I'm sure it could be made
better.

If you find any bugs please let me know at snackeru@tc.umn.edu.
